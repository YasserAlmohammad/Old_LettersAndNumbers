# Old_LettersAndNumbers
Des Chiffres et des Lettres using Java
Note: this is an old college project for game of Letters and numbers in 2005 i think.

UI :

You choose new game and need to select a dictionary file ( any text file with words works just fine)
You define the time out value in the field bellow then we begin by a letter match.
players can pick their letters, each from his own panel, one at a time, when they both end their share (9 letters here) the timer fires immediately and they have to put the answer in the white text field bellow, the dictionary is vied inside the text area in the middle.

above 30 sec. have passed.
If each kept the answer as it is we get the match result like bellow: player1 gets 0 for no match to his choice and player2 gets 2 for one match of two letters
The left players could choose THINK as best available mix and right player could choose OFF as the best mix

A player can also click done to announce that heâ€™s done, so if the other player clicked done too, the match ends and result calculation begins immediately without waiting for the time out.

Press next match after done of the current match ( clicking any button out of order wont affect anything, they are all tied up with each other so no button miss the game, for example: pressing NEXT MATCH wont do a thing unless current match is over) 

The second match is a letters match too, both ended by pressing done and first player gets 3 points and player2 get 2 and total result becomes 3-4
